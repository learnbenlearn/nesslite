**To Do List:**  
- [ ] standardize snapshots  
- output to snapshot file every 1,000 timesteps?

- [ x] look into cleaning up repetitive output code in nesslite.c

- [ x] clean up repetitive code in python output files

- [ ] fix angular momentum and (to a much lesser extent) energy conservation

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

way down the line:

- [ ] support for restarting simulations from output files?

- [ ] prettier visualization?
